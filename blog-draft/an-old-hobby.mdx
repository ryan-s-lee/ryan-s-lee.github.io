League of Legends used to be a hobby, to put it lightly. I was 
half-decent at it, and its real-time team nature forced me to engage with
it mentally even if I had run out of energy, not to mention it was 
addicting. But I've finally figured out how to
break from it. It mainly boiled down to two things: learning all the minutiae of 
managing my energy, and finally learning to learn.

On top of the lifestyle management and ergonomics, I figured out a few 
tricks to get myself to sleep better (more air conditioning, extra pillows,
less light in the room, tire myself both physically and mentally during 
the day so that
I really feel the need to rest). With the extra energy, I had plenty of mental 
energy to actually learn things, instead of only having the energy to play
LoL. 

But even if I had energy, I could end up wasting it by spinning my 
gears on tough concepts I would never understand without learning to learn
properly. I recall that in high school, due to all the craze over tech, I 
went straight to neural networks, tensorflow, 
OS design, and how to use an Arduino. I spent countless hours trying and 
failing to learn these high-level concepts, and countless more recovering 
mental energy after doing so (i.e. lying in bed). Enormous amounts of time, 
low gain.

Early in college, I learned that some things are best introduced with a 
video showing examples of how a concept or tool is used; Youtube was an 
excellent tool for this. Seeing concretely how something was used allowed me to
emulate it and later map stuff I learned later to the techniques I learned over 
video. Video alone, however, is still not as fast or as thorough as reading. 
So I learned to read textbooks, which was actually a matter of pacing. First, 
I could do a little skimming, but ulimately I had to start from the very 
beginning, actively control myself from skipping forward, and draw mental images
of what the textbook described. If I found that I was repeatedly and unconciously
glazing over some pieces of the text, I would take a 20 minute break
during which I would lie in bed and try to empty my brain as best I could, 
or pace around/stand and do the same thing if I wasn't feeling like lying down. 

Finally, I learned through experience and college courses what the "basic" 
concepts were. In college, I discovered that I first
had to learn discrete math, set theory, what an HTTP request really is,
the formal definition of a language, the definition of computation 
and what a computer really was (everything's represented with an array of 
characters, and we just happened to pick 1s and 0s because they're easy to 
represent with voltages on transistor pins), computer architecture, 
how voltage worked, data structures, all sorts of basics. From there, learning specific 
languages like Python, C, and HTML came easier, because I knew what they
were for (e.g. HTML represents <i>information</i>; it's not just a way to
decorate web pages, which is what CSS is for, and even that is just 
information for the browser renderer). And from there libraries like React come 
easier.
And with that came the power to build actual projects and practice using 
all kinds of tools in a constructive way. Even the Arduino has become less
daunting, even though I wasn't focusing on studying hardware. With that kind
of power, I gravitated toward actually using it and growing my abilities, 
because that kind of activity had finally become fruitful. From there, 
quitting League came naturally.

In a weird way, LoL pushed me toward a lot of the hobbies I have today.
So I can't say it was a total waste of time. It was also a huge part of 
my life in middle and high school, giving me escape from long nights of 
homework. But I've definitely outgrown it, and I'm glad that I have the 
time and energy to do other things that matter more to me.
