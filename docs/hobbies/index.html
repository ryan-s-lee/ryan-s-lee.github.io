It saves me money. I can make my food taste good and make it healthy. If food tastes bad I can improve it next time. I can make whatever I want, and shape it to my tastes or attempt to make it as authentic as I can (especially if I have friends or family who know regional cuisine!) I can also get <i>faster</i>; if I want a meal in 30 minutes I can whip up a basic chicken-rice-vegetable dish instead of heading to a burger place.</p><p>Running! I should do this more often lol. It makes me tired in 20-30 minutes compared to spending an hour at the gym, though I still need to go to the gym to actually break muscle fibers. I can do it anywhere. It&#x27;s good for my heart. I guess it can help me get places faster, if I&#x27;m willing to look weird running all over the place.</p><p>Does lifestyle management count? I guess cooking falls into this category. I love figuring out if I can do some daily task faster (see cooking), easier, or in parallel with other tasks. I guess that&#x27;s related to me study computer science! Concerning making tasks easier, a good example is figuring out how to discover my classwork for the day. In the past I would have to type out course websites or click through a course management system every time I wanted to figure out what to do. I fixed that by using <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> to build a wiki page with links to relevant course sites, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about forgetting to check a certain site and cut down on the clicking around. Also, I got a bike specifically to cut down on commute time to and between classes, though it&#x27;s also fun in its own right.</p><p>Another &quot;hobby&quot; is (informally) studying and spending on ergonomic stuff. Before college I didn&#x27;t know that constantly shuffling around in my too-high desk and short-backed chair, banging my legs against the desk stabilizer plank or whatever it&#x27;s called, and craning my neck and leaning over to look at my low, tiny laptop screen for hours straight was eating into my energy. Thus I ended up lying on my bed a lot instead of learning new things like I wanted to. After getting into college, I got myself a standing desk and a Steelcase Leap off of Facebook Marketplace; and a monitor and monitor stand. With each addition my productivity went up what felt like 20%, scaling multiplicatively. It was kind of incredible how well I could work after getting the whole setup. It was more a pleasure than a pain. Next up is a trackball mouse!</p><h3>Old Hobbies</h3><p>League of Legends used to be a hobby haha. I was half-decent at it, and its real-time team nature forced me to engage with it mentally even if I had run out of energy, not to mention it was addicting. But I&#x27;ve finally figured out how to break from it. It mainly boiled down to two things: learning all the minutiae of managing my energy, and finally learning to learn.</p><p>On top of the lifestyle management and ergonomics, I figured out a few tricks to get myself to sleep better (making myself colder, extra pillows, less light in the room, tire myself both physically and mentally during the day so that I really feel the need to rest). With the extra energy, I had plenty of mental energy to actually learn things, instead of only having the energy to play LoL.</p><p>But even if I had energy, I could end up wasting it by spinning my gears on tough concepts I would never understand without learning to learn properly. First, I learned that some things are best introduced with a video showing examples of how a concept or tool is used. Then, I learned to read textbooks, which was actually a matter of pacing: if I found that I was glazing over some pieces of the text, I would take a 20 minute break during which I would lie in bed and try to empty my brain as best I could, or pace/stand doing the same thing if I wasn&#x27;t feeling like lying down.</p><p>Finally, I learned through experience and college courses what the &quot;basic&quot; concepts were. I recall that in high school, due to all the craze over tech, I went straight to neural networks, tensorflow, OS design, and how to use an Arduino. I spent countless hours trying and failing to learn these high-level concepts, and countless more recovering mental energy after doing so. In college, I discovered that I first had to learn discrete math, set theory, what an HTTP request really is, the formal definition of a language, the definition of computation and what a computer really was (everything&#x27;s represented with a tape of characters, and we just happened to pick 1s and 0s for convenience!), computer architecture, how voltage worked, data structures, all sorts of basics. From there, learning specific languages like Python, C, and HTML came easier, because I knew what they were for (e.g. HTML represents <i>information</i>; it&#x27;s not just a way to decorate web pages, which is what CSS is for, and even that is just information for the browser renderer). And from there libraries come easier. And with that came the power to build actual projects and practice using all kinds of tools in a constructive way. Even the Arduino has become less daunting, even though I wasn&#x27;t focusing on studying hardware. With that kind of power, I gravitated toward actually using it and growing my abilities, because that kind of activity had finally become fruitful. From there, quitting League came naturally.<br/><br/>In a weird way, LoL pushed me toward a lot of the hobbies I have today. So I can&#x27;t say it was a total waste of time. It was also a huge part of my life in middle and high school, giving me escape from long nights of homework. But I&#x27;ve definitely outgrown it, and I&#x27;m glad that I have the time and energy to do other things that matter more to me.</p></main></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/hobbies/";/*]]>*/</script><!-- slice-start id="_gatsby-scripts-1" -->
